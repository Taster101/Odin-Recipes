    <p>Chesse Alfredo sauce isnt just for pasta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>2 cloves garlic</li> 
       <li>1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
       <li>Pinch red pepper flakes, plus more for sprinkling</li>
       <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
       <li>1 1/4 ounces grated Parmesan cheese (1/2 cup)</li>
       <li> Kosher salt</li>
       <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Arrange rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 450Â°F. If the dough is cold, let sit at room temperature at least 2 hours before proceeding. The dough is ready when it does not bounce back when stretched. </li>
        <li>Mince 2 cloves garlic. Finely grate 1 1/4 ounces Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup). Melt 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes and cook, stirring a few times, until fragrant and lightly browned, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add 1 1/2 cups heavy cream and whisk until combined. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce is reduced by half and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 7 to 12 minutes. Add the Parmesan and whisk to combine. Taste and season with kosher salt and black pepper as needed. (You should have 1 cup sauce). Remove from the heat and let cool slightly while preparing the toppings and dough.</li>
       </ol>
